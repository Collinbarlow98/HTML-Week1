  <li>One Piece</li>
  <p>One Piece is a story about a boy who turns into rubber and has the dream of becoming the Pirate King. The boys name is Luffy, and at the age of 16 he sets out to adventure on the seas to gather crewmates for his pirate ship. His first crewmate is Zoro (best boy) a skilled swordsman who uses the three swords technique. One may ask how does some one use three swords at the same time? well the answer is simple, the swordsman has one sword in each hand as well as one sword in his mouth, 2 hands plus one mouth means 3 swords. When these two meet Zoro is actually imprisoned by the marines at a marine base in a town on an island, the world of one piece is made of primarily islands, however this particular base is manned by a corrupt captain and is making the citizens of the towns lives difficult. Luffy meets with Zoro while he is imprisoned and decides that Zoro is actually a good guy and decides he will be a part of his crew, even though Zoro continuosly denied the invitation. So in order to convice Zoro to join, Luffy over heard that the marine captains son was going to execute Zoro despite the deal that Zoro and the son had made, Luffy got mad at this, and decided to go free Zoro, while doing so however he also extorted Zoro telling him that he will only free Zoro if he joins the crew, giving Zoro the option of either dieing or becoming a pirate. Zoro made a promise to a childhood friend who died a long time ago and so he had no choice but to join Luffy on the condition that if Luffy ever got in the way of his promise then Zoro would kill Luffy and continue on his own. So, after being set free Zoro along with Luffy defeated the corrupt captain and the marine base soldiers being oppressed as well as the towns people celebrated, however since Luffy and Zoro are still priates the marines decided that they would let the two go for this, but they could not let them stay in town after the celebration. With that the two set off to find their next adventure. While on Luffy's small boat Luffy gets hungery, so he uses his rubber arm to stretch into the air and grab a bird however the bird is bigger than he thought and pulls Luffy along with him in flight. This causes Zoro to paddle after Luffy and the Bird. At some point the bird gets shot out of the air by a cannon and drops Luffy, luckily for Luffy they were above a town because if Luffy had fallen into to ocean he would have drowned because people who gain powers like becoming rubber lose their ability to swim. So, Luffy falls from the sky into a town, when he lands he meets a girl who is being harassed by thugs, the girl uses him to run away and let him deal with the thugs. Luffy easily does so and starts talking with the girl. The girls name is Nami (best girl) she is a thief who only steals from pirates, as well as a very skilled navigator and offers Luffy to join her after seeing how strong he is. Luffy declines the offer, telling her he is a pirate captain, and Nami becomes very upset at learning he is a pirate, she despises pirates. Nami after seeing how naive he is though comes up with a plan to infiltrate the pirate crew that has taken over and forced the citizens out of their town captained by, Buggy the Clown, she decideds to tie Luffy up, he lets her(naive), and she guides him to Buggy where she turns him in along with the item she stole, claiming she wants to join Buggy, when really she just wants to steal his treasure along with the map of the grand line, the most dangrous sea in the world. Buggy accepts and the pirate crew celebrates the new recruit, after throwing Luffy in a cage, toward the end of the celebreation however, Buggy orders Nami to blow Luffy up with the cannon. This causes her to hesitate, she can't do it, and Luffy calls her out with a bad ass line about what it truly means to be a pirate. She gives up her rouse to stop from killing Luffy, and at that moment Zoro comes to the rescue where he fights Buggy and thinks he has beaten Buggy but Buggy has powers like Luffy and survives at the same time as giving Zoro and bad wound. The three in a tight spot decide to run away with Zoro carrying Luffy's cage, while Nami turns the cannon on the crew and fires it. The three make their escape.
